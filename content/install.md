# Install R (first)

R and RStudio are two separate programs. You must install R first, then install RStudio desktop

-   Windows -- download from: <https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/>

-   Mac OS -- download the latest .pkg file from: <https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/> (top link)

# Install RStudio (second)

-   Select the RStudio desktop download file corresponding to your operating system from: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download>

# Open RStudio

Open RStudio by clicking on the RStudio icon (round blue circle with an R in the center). Do not open the regular R software. R will work in the background when you use RStudio.

> `R` is a language. `RStudio` is an "IDE" or Integrated Development Environment that makes programming with R so much easier. You don't *have* to use RStudio, but it's recommended.
