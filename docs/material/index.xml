      <description>Slides here Basics of R R is a programming language designed for statistical modelling and data analysis. It is heavily supported by an active community, where new tools for data handling, visualization, and statistical analysis are constantly developed and shared.
The learning goals for today are:
become familiar with R, its syntax and basic principles know how to use R as a calculator understand and write simple R scripts perform basic operations on data be able to make simple plots First steps R is an interpreted language meaning that you can evaluate it line by line.</description>
